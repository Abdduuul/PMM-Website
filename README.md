# Blueprint for Modern Web Project

## Overview
This project is a framework-less web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to leverage modern web standards and provide a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing user experience. It is developed within the Firebase Studio environment, utilizing its preview server for real-time feedback.

## Current Design and Features
*   **Color Palette:** The application now uses the following color palette:
    *   `--color-dark-teal`: #003C43
    *   `--color-medium-teal`: #135D66
    *   `--color-light-teal`: #77B0AA
    *   `--color-very-light-teal`: #E3FEF7

## Plan for Current Change
No specific plan for a new change. The last action was to update the color palette in `style.css` and document it here.
